\title{This funciton groups an all_items file (a file that has all the classified
items from multiple databases) by a specified knowledge base. First, it condenses
all the classified deciles, so there is 1 entry per concept. The score2 valus
are summed together, so that each concept has 1 value for it's overall trend.
Max value for this parameter is 90 (3 databases * mas score2 of 3 * 10 decades)}
\usage{
